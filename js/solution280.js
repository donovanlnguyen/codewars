// You'll be given a list of two strings, and each will contain exactly one colon (":") 
// in the middle (but not at beginning or end). The length of the strings, before and after the colon, 
// are random.

// Your job is to return a list of two strings (in the same order as the original list), 
// but with the characters after each colon swapped.
