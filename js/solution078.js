// This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being the exponent.
// Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. 
// Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when exponent = 2.
